## [Unreleased] - 2026-06-25

### Changed

- Archived `docs/PRD.md` and `docs/ROADMAP.md` to `docs/ARCHIVE.md`;
  canonical content now lives under `specs/`
  (`specs/mission.md`, `specs/roadmap.md`, and per-feature folders
  under `specs/YYYY-MM-DD-<name>/`).
- Landed the in-progress `packages/ast-tooling` refactor: Worker now
  renders Handlebars templates through the injected LLMProvider with a
  zod-constrained schema; SAGA normalizes the planner's version-suffixed
  module names; ModuleRegistry supports user-scope and project-marketplace
  dedup with symlink resolution; action loader now resolves
  action-level and module-level validators from kebab-case filenames.
- Fixed `packages/agent-engine` import path: `openai-compatible` now
  resolves from `./providers/openai-compatible.js` (matches the actual
  file location after the providers split).
- Inlined a minimal `loadSession` equivalent in
  `apps/cli/src/commands/module-design/consistency.ts` to work around
  the tsx ESM static-analysis issue when Node cannot verify named
  exports from a `.ts` package entry.
